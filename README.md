# Introduction 
A deep learning based approach which uses *haar face detector* for preprocessing of the dataset, a convolutional neural network for binary classification of images and state-of-the-art deep learning based *mtcnn* face detector to test the model on crowded images. The underlying dataset, provided by Pranjna Bhandary can be found [here](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data).
